# Info

This is a **mobile** web application that looks best at slim resolutions. Its styles are dynamic so will not break at higher resolutions, but it lacks detail on a standard monitor.
The app itself displays number sequences, titled, sampled from, and described - with the algorithm used to attain each sequence available below it, written in Javascript. This project is just a way for me to dedicate some time to writing numerical algorithms because I think they are fun to optimize. It's built with Angular 9 and is fully dynamic so will handle sequences coming in at a large scale. No additional HTML or CSS will be written as new algorithms are built into it, only TS-based services that convert everything to presentable information.
